# CollisionDetection
Many games need to handle collisions, especially arcade games. Simply said, we need to detect when two objects collide on screen.
This is a project at which an enemy will be created for the previous Spaceship class that shot missiles.
We add a new Alien sprite. We will detect two types of collisions: when the missile hits an alien ship and when our spacecraft collides with an alien.
